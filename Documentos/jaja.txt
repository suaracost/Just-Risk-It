GREGORY.
The heads of the maids?


GREGORY.

GREGORY.
How? Turn thy back and run?


GREGORY.

ABRAM.
Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?


ABRAM.

ABRAM.
Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?


ABRAM.

SAMPSON.
Is the law of our side if I say ay?


SAMPSON.

GREGORY.
Do you quarrel, sir?


GREGORY.

LADY CAPULET.
A crutch, a crutch! Why call you for a sword?


LADY CAPULET.

MONTAGUE.
Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach?
Speak, nephew, were you by when it began?


MONTAGUE.

BENVOLIO.
My noble uncle, do you know the cause?


BENVOLIO.

BENVOLIO.
Have you importun’d him by any means?


BENVOLIO.

ROMEO.
Is the day so young?


ROMEO.

ROMEO.
Ay me, sad hours seem long.
Was that my father that went hence so fast?


ROMEO.

BENVOLIO.
It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo’s hours?


BENVOLIO.

BENVOLIO.
In love?


BENVOLIO.

BENVOLIO.
Of love?


BENVOLIO.

ROMEO.
Alas that love, whose view is muffled still,
Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will!
Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here?
Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all.
Here’s much to do with hate, but more with love:
Why, then, O brawling love! O loving hate!
O anything, of nothing first create!
O heavy lightness! serious vanity!
Misshapen chaos of well-seeming forms!
Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health!
Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is!
This love feel I, that feel no love in this.
Dost thou not laugh?


ROMEO.

ROMEO.
Good heart, at what?


ROMEO.

BENVOLIO.
Tell me in sadness who is that you love?


BENVOLIO.

ROMEO.
What, shall I groan and tell thee?


ROMEO.

BENVOLIO.
Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?


BENVOLIO.

PARIS.
Of honourable reckoning are you both,
And pity ’tis you liv’d at odds so long.
But now my lord, what say you to my suit?


PARIS.

BENVOLIO.
For what, I pray thee?


BENVOLIO.

BENVOLIO.
Why, Romeo, art thou mad?


BENVOLIO.

SERVANT.
God gi’ go-den. I pray, sir, can you read?


SERVANT.

SERVANT.
Perhaps you have learned it without book.
But I pray, can you read anything you see?


SERVANT.

ROMEO.
Whither to supper?


ROMEO.

ROMEO.
Whose house?


ROMEO.

JULIET.
How now, who calls?


JULIET.

JULIET.
Madam, I am here. What is your will?


JULIET.

NURSE.
I’ll lay fourteen of my teeth,
And yet, to my teen be it spoken, I have but four,
She is not fourteen. How long is it now
To Lammas-tide?


NURSE.

LADY CAPULET.
Marry, that marry is the very theme
I came to talk of. Tell me, daughter Juliet,
How stands your disposition to be married?


LADY CAPULET.

LADY CAPULET.
Speak briefly, can you like of Paris’ love?


LADY CAPULET.

ROMEO.
What, shall this speech be spoke for our excuse?
Or shall we on without apology?


ROMEO.

MERCUTIO.
Why, may one ask?


MERCUTIO.

ROMEO.
Well what was yours?


ROMEO.

ROMEO.
What lady is that, which doth enrich the hand
Of yonder knight?


ROMEO.

CAPULET.
Why how now, kinsman!
Wherefore storm you so?


CAPULET.

CAPULET.
Young Romeo, is it?


CAPULET.

ROMEO.
Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?


ROMEO.

ROMEO.
What is her mother?


ROMEO.

JULIET.
Come hither, Nurse. What is yond gentleman?


JULIET.

JULIET.
What’s he that now is going out of door?


JULIET.

JULIET.
What’s he that follows here, that would not dance?


JULIET.

NURSE.
What’s this? What’s this?


NURSE.

MERCUTIO.
If love be blind, love cannot hit the mark.
Now will he sit under a medlar tree,
And wish his mistress were that kind of fruit
As maids call medlars when they laugh alone.
O Romeo, that she were, O that she were
An open-arse and thou a poperin pear!
Romeo, good night. I’ll to my truckle-bed.
This field-bed is too cold for me to sleep.
Come, shall we go?


MERCUTIO.

ROMEO.
[_Aside._] Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?


ROMEO.

JULIET.
What man art thou that, thus bescreen’d in night
So stumblest on my counsel?


JULIET.

JULIET.
My ears have yet not drunk a hundred words
Of thy tongue’s utterance, yet I know the sound.
Art thou not Romeo, and a Montague?


JULIET.

JULIET.
By whose direction found’st thou out this place?


JULIET.

ROMEO.
What shall I swear by?


ROMEO.

ROMEO.
O wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?


ROMEO.

JULIET.
What satisfaction canst thou have tonight?


JULIET.

ROMEO.
Would’st thou withdraw it? For what purpose, love?


ROMEO.

ROMEO.
My nyas?


ROMEO.

JULIET.
What o’clock tomorrow
Shall I send to thee?


JULIET.

FRIAR LAWRENCE.
God pardon sin. Wast thou with Rosaline?


FRIAR LAWRENCE.

FRIAR LAWRENCE.
That’s my good son. But where hast thou been then?


FRIAR LAWRENCE.

MERCUTIO.
Where the devil should this Romeo be? Came he not home tonight?


MERCUTIO.

MERCUTIO.
Alas poor Romeo, he is already dead, stabbed with a white wench’s black
eye; run through the ear with a love song, the very pin of his heart
cleft with the blind bow-boy’s butt-shaft. And is he a man to encounter
Tybalt?


MERCUTIO.

BENVOLIO.
Why, what is Tybalt?


BENVOLIO.

BENVOLIO.
The what?


BENVOLIO.

ROMEO.
Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit did I give you?


ROMEO.

MERCUTIO.
The slip sir, the slip; can you not conceive?


MERCUTIO.

MERCUTIO.
Nay, if thy wits run the wild-goose chase, I am done. For thou hast
more of the wild-goose in one of thy wits, than I am sure, I have in my
whole five. Was I with you there for the goose?


MERCUTIO.

ROMEO.
And is it not then well served in to a sweet goose?


ROMEO.

NURSE.
Is it good-den?


NURSE.

NURSE.
Out upon you! What a man are you?


NURSE.

NURSE.
By my troth, it is well said; for himself to mar, quoth a? Gentlemen,
can any of you tell me where I may find the young Romeo?


NURSE.

ROMEO.
What hast thou found?


ROMEO.

NURSE.
I pray you, sir, what saucy merchant was this that was so full of his
ropery?


NURSE.

ROMEO.
What say’st thou, my dear Nurse?


ROMEO.

NURSE.
Is your man secret? Did you ne’er hear say,
Two may keep counsel, putting one away?


NURSE.

NURSE.
Well, sir, my mistress is the sweetest lady. Lord, Lord! When ’twas a
little prating thing,—O, there is a nobleman in town, one Paris, that
would fain lay knife aboard; but she, good soul, had as lief see a
toad, a very toad, as see him. I anger her sometimes, and tell her that
Paris is the properer man, but I’ll warrant you, when I say so, she
looks as pale as any clout in the versal world. Doth not rosemary and
Romeo begin both with a letter?


NURSE.

NURSE.
Jesu, what haste? Can you not stay a while? Do you not see that I am
out of breath?


NURSE.

JULIET.
How art thou out of breath, when thou hast breath
To say to me that thou art out of breath?
The excuse that thou dost make in this delay
Is longer than the tale thou dost excuse.
Is thy news good or bad? Answer to that;
Say either, and I’ll stay the circumstance.
Let me be satisfied, is’t good or bad?


JULIET.

NURSE.
Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not how to choose a man.
Romeo? No, not he. Though his face be better than any man’s, yet his
leg excels all men’s, and for a hand and a foot, and a body, though
they be not to be talked on, yet they are past compare. He is not the
flower of courtesy, but I’ll warrant him as gentle as a lamb. Go thy
ways, wench, serve God. What, have you dined at home?


NURSE.

JULIET.
No, no. But all this did I know before.
What says he of our marriage? What of that?


JULIET.

JULIET.
I’faith, I am sorry that thou art not well.
Sweet, sweet, sweet Nurse, tell me, what says my love?


JULIET.

NURSE.
Your love says like an honest gentleman,
And a courteous, and a kind, and a handsome,
And I warrant a virtuous,—Where is your mother?


NURSE.

JULIET.
Here’s such a coil. Come, what says Romeo?


JULIET.

NURSE.
Have you got leave to go to shrift today?


NURSE.

BENVOLIO.
Am I like such a fellow?


BENVOLIO.

BENVOLIO.
And what to?


BENVOLIO.

MERCUTIO.
Could you not take some occasion without giving?


MERCUTIO.

MERCUTIO.
O calm, dishonourable, vile submission!
[_Draws._] Alla stoccata carries it away.
Tybalt, you rat-catcher, will you walk?


MERCUTIO.

TYBALT.
What wouldst thou have with me?


TYBALT.

MERCUTIO.
I am hurt.
A plague o’ both your houses. I am sped.
Is he gone, and hath nothing?


MERCUTIO.

BENVOLIO.
What, art thou hurt?


BENVOLIO.

BENVOLIO.
Why dost thou stay?


BENVOLIO.

FIRST CITIZEN.
Which way ran he that kill’d Mercutio?
Tybalt, that murderer, which way ran he?


FIRST CITIZEN.

PRINCE.
Where are the vile beginners of this fray?


PRINCE.

PRINCE.
Benvolio, who began this bloody fray?


PRINCE.

PRINCE.
Romeo slew him, he slew Mercutio.
Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe?


PRINCE.

JULIET.
Ay me, what news? Why dost thou wring thy hands?


JULIET.

JULIET.
Can heaven be so envious?


JULIET.

JULIET.
What storm is this that blows so contrary?
Is Romeo slaughter’d and is Tybalt dead?
My dearest cousin, and my dearer lord?
Then dreadful trumpet sound the general doom,
For who is living, if those two are gone?


JULIET.

JULIET.
O God! Did Romeo’s hand shed Tybalt’s blood?


JULIET.

NURSE.
Will you speak well of him that kill’d your cousin?


NURSE.

JULIET.
Shall I speak ill of him that is my husband?
Ah, poor my lord, what tongue shall smooth thy name,
When I thy three-hours’ wife have mangled it?
But wherefore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin?
That villain cousin would have kill’d my husband.
Back, foolish tears, back to your native spring,
Your tributary drops belong to woe,
Which you mistaking offer up to joy.
My husband lives, that Tybalt would have slain,
And Tybalt’s dead, that would have slain my husband.
All this is comfort; wherefore weep I then?
Some word there was, worser than Tybalt’s death,
That murder’d me. I would forget it fain,
But O, it presses to my memory
Like damned guilty deeds to sinners’ minds.
Tybalt is dead, and Romeo banished.
That ‘banished,’ that one word ‘banished,’
Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts. Tybalt’s death
Was woe enough, if it had ended there.
Or if sour woe delights in fellowship,
And needly will be rank’d with other griefs,
Why follow’d not, when she said Tybalt’s dead,
Thy father or thy mother, nay or both,
Which modern lamentation might have mov’d?
But with a rear-ward following Tybalt’s death,
‘Romeo is banished’—to speak that word
Is father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet,
All slain, all dead. Romeo is banished,
There is no end, no limit, measure, bound,
In that word’s death, no words can that woe sound.
Where is my father and my mother, Nurse?


JULIET.

ROMEO.
Father, what news? What is the Prince’s doom?
What sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand,
That I yet know not?


ROMEO.

ROMEO.
What less than doomsday is the Prince’s doom?


ROMEO.

ROMEO.
’Tis torture, and not mercy. Heaven is here
Where Juliet lives, and every cat and dog,
And little mouse, every unworthy thing,
Live here in heaven and may look on her,
But Romeo may not. More validity,
More honourable state, more courtship lives
In carrion flies than Romeo. They may seize
On the white wonder of dear Juliet’s hand,
And steal immortal blessing from her lips,
Who, even in pure and vestal modesty
Still blush, as thinking their own kisses sin.
But Romeo may not, he is banished.
This may flies do, when I from this must fly.
They are free men but I am banished.
And say’st thou yet that exile is not death?
Hadst thou no poison mix’d, no sharp-ground knife,
No sudden mean of death, though ne’er so mean,
But banished to kill me? Banished?
O Friar, the damned use that word in hell.
Howling attends it. How hast thou the heart,
Being a divine, a ghostly confessor,
A sin-absolver, and my friend profess’d,
To mangle me with that word banished?


ROMEO.

ROMEO.
How should they, when that wise men have no eyes?


ROMEO.

NURSE.
O holy Friar, O, tell me, holy Friar,
Where is my lady’s lord, where’s Romeo?


NURSE.

NURSE.
O, he is even in my mistress’ case.
Just in her case! O woeful sympathy!
Piteous predicament. Even so lies she,
Blubbering and weeping, weeping and blubbering.
Stand up, stand up; stand, and you be a man.
For Juliet’s sake, for her sake, rise and stand.
Why should you fall into so deep an O?


NURSE.

ROMEO.
Spakest thou of Juliet? How is it with her?
Doth not she think me an old murderer,
Now I have stain’d the childhood of our joy
With blood remov’d but little from her own?
Where is she? And how doth she? And what says
My conceal’d lady to our cancell’d love?


ROMEO.

CAPULET.
Sir Paris, I will make a desperate tender
Of my child’s love. I think she will be rul’d
In all respects by me; nay more, I doubt it not.
Wife, go you to her ere you go to bed,
Acquaint her here of my son Paris’ love,
And bid her, mark you me, on Wednesday next,
But, soft, what day is this?


CAPULET.

CAPULET.
Monday! Ha, ha! Well, Wednesday is too soon,
A Thursday let it be; a Thursday, tell her,
She shall be married to this noble earl.
Will you be ready? Do you like this haste?
We’ll keep no great ado,—a friend or two,
For, hark you, Tybalt being slain so late,
It may be thought we held him carelessly,
Being our kinsman, if we revel much.
Therefore we’ll have some half a dozen friends,
And there an end. But what say you to Thursday?


CAPULET.

JULIET.
Nurse?


JULIET.

JULIET.
O thinkest thou we shall ever meet again?


JULIET.

LADY CAPULET.
[_Within._] Ho, daughter, are you up?


LADY CAPULET.

JULIET.
Who is’t that calls? Is it my lady mother?
Is she not down so late, or up so early?
What unaccustom’d cause procures her hither?


JULIET.

LADY CAPULET.
Why, how now, Juliet?


LADY CAPULET.

JULIET.
What villain, madam?


JULIET.

JULIET.
And joy comes well in such a needy time.
What are they, I beseech your ladyship?


JULIET.

JULIET.
Madam, in happy time, what day is that?


JULIET.

CAPULET.
When the sun sets, the air doth drizzle dew;
But for the sunset of my brother’s son
It rains downright.
How now? A conduit, girl? What, still in tears?
Evermore showering? In one little body
Thou counterfeits a bark, a sea, a wind.
For still thy eyes, which I may call the sea,
Do ebb and flow with tears; the bark thy body is,
Sailing in this salt flood, the winds, thy sighs,
Who raging with thy tears and they with them,
Without a sudden calm will overset
Thy tempest-tossed body. How now, wife?
Have you deliver’d to her our decree?


CAPULET.

CAPULET.
Soft. Take me with you, take me with you, wife.
How, will she none? Doth she not give us thanks?
Is she not proud? Doth she not count her blest,
Unworthy as she is, that we have wrought
So worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom?


CAPULET.

LADY CAPULET.
Fie, fie! What, are you mad?


LADY CAPULET.

NURSE.
May not one speak?


NURSE.

JULIET.
Speakest thou from thy heart?


JULIET.

NURSE.
What?


NURSE.

PARIS.
Come you to make confession to this father?


PARIS.

JULIET.
It may be so, for it is not mine own.
Are you at leisure, holy father, now,
Or shall I come to you at evening mass?


JULIET.

CAPULET.
How canst thou try them so?


CAPULET.

CAPULET.
How now, my headstrong. Where have you been gadding?


CAPULET.

JULIET.
Nurse, will you go with me into my closet,
To help me sort such needful ornaments
As you think fit to furnish me tomorrow?


JULIET.

LADY CAPULET.
What, are you busy, ho? Need you my help?


LADY CAPULET.

LADY CAPULET.
What noise is here?


LADY CAPULET.

LADY CAPULET.
What is the matter?


LADY CAPULET.

FRIAR LAWRENCE.
Come, is the bride ready to go to church?


FRIAR LAWRENCE.

PARIS.
Have I thought long to see this morning’s face,
And doth it give me such a sight as this?


PARIS.

FIRST MUSICIAN.
Why ‘Heart’s ease’?


FIRST MUSICIAN.

PETER.
You will not then?


PETER.

FIRST MUSICIAN.
What will you give us?


FIRST MUSICIAN.

PETER.
Then will I lay the serving-creature’s dagger on your pate. I will
carry no crotchets. I’ll re you, I’ll fa you. Do you note me?


PETER.

PETER.
Then have at you with my wit. I will dry-beat you with an iron wit, and
put up my iron dagger. Answer me like men.
    ‘When griping griefs the heart doth wound,
      And doleful dumps the mind oppress,
    Then music with her silver sound’—
Why ‘silver sound’? Why ‘music with her silver sound’? What say you,
Simon Catling?


PETER.

PETER.
Prates. What say you, Hugh Rebeck?


PETER.

PETER.
Prates too! What say you, James Soundpost?


PETER.

ROMEO.
Tush, thou art deceiv’d.
Leave me, and do the thing I bid thee do.
Hast thou no letters to me from the Friar?


ROMEO.

APOTHECARY.
Who calls so loud?


APOTHECARY.

FRIAR LAWRENCE.
Who bare my letter then to Romeo?


FRIAR LAWRENCE.

FRIAR LAWRENCE.
Saint Francis be my speed. How oft tonight
Have my old feet stumbled at graves? Who’s there?
Who is it that consorts, so late, the dead?


FRIAR LAWRENCE.

FRIAR LAWRENCE.
Who is it?


FRIAR LAWRENCE.

FRIAR LAWRENCE.
How long hath he been there?


FRIAR LAWRENCE.

FRIAR LAWRENCE.
Romeo! [_Advances._]
Alack, alack, what blood is this which stains
The stony entrance of this sepulchre?
What mean these masterless and gory swords
To lie discolour’d by this place of peace?


FRIAR LAWRENCE.

JULIET.
O comfortable Friar, where is my lord?
I do remember well where I should be,
And there I am. Where is my Romeo?


JULIET.

FIRST WATCH.
[_Within._] Lead, boy. Which way?


FIRST WATCH.

PRINCE.
What misadventure is so early up,
That calls our person from our morning’s rest?


PRINCE.

CAPULET.
What should it be that they so shriek abroad?


CAPULET.

PRINCE.
What fear is this which startles in our ears?


PRINCE.

MONTAGUE.
Alas, my liege, my wife is dead tonight.
Grief of my son’s exile hath stopp’d her breath.
What further woe conspires against mine age?


MONTAGUE.

MONTAGUE.
O thou untaught! What manners is in this,
To press before thy father to a grave?


MONTAGUE.

PRINCE.
We still have known thee for a holy man.
Where’s Romeo’s man? What can he say to this?


PRINCE.

PRINCE.
Give me the letter, I will look on it.
Where is the County’s Page that rais’d the watch?
Sirrah, what made your master in this place?


PRINCE.
